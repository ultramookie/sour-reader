Just me learning about SimpleXML and RSS and Atom.  Maybe even write
something I'll actually use.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
        php5 (with simplexml)
        mysql
	crontab access

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
        copy all files over to wherever you want to host your reader.

        from that location, move config-example.php to config.php.

        edit config.php and enter the correct mysql database information.

        point your webbrowser to http://<yoursiteurl>/<sourlocation>/install.php

        fill out information.

	you need to add to your crontab two wget calls:

	one to update the database:
	*/20 * * * * wget -q http://<yoursiteurl>/<sourlocation>/rssatom.php -O /dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1

	one to purge old articles:
	0 0 * * * wget -q http://<yoursiteurl>/<sourlocation>/purgeold.php -O /dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1

        enjoy.

Have fun.  This is a tool I will keep tweaking and playing with to learn.  So,
check the github repo for updates:

Use at your own risk :)
